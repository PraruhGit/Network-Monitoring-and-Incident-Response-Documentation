## 1. Introduction

This document describes the implementation of a **Network Monitoring and Incident Response** system designed to ensure continuous network availability and performance. The system continuously monitors network connectivity and key performance metrics, automatically alerts on anomalies, and triggers predefined incident response procedures to mitigate network issues rapidly.

---

## 2. System Overview

The network monitoring solution consists of two main components:

- **Monitoring Component:**  
  A Python-based script that collects network metrics such as latency, packet loss, and throughput using ICMP ping tests and other diagnostic commands. It logs metrics and triggers alerts when thresholds are breached.

- **Incident Response Component:**  
  Automated scripts that, upon detection of network anomalies, execute corrective actions (e.g., restarting network services, switching failover routes) and notify administrators via email or messaging systems. Detailed escalation procedures are provided for manual intervention.

---

## 3. Pre-requisites

Before setting up the system, ensure the following:

- **Operating System:**  
  Unix-like OS (Linux).

- **Python 3:**  
  Installed on the monitoring server.

- **Required Python Packages:**  
  Install necessary packages such as `ping3` for ping tests, `requests` for sending alerts, and `logging` for logging events:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y
  pip3 install ping3 requests
  ```

- **Network Tools:**  
  Standard network diagnostic tools (e.g., `ping`, `traceroute`) should be available on the system.

- **Email/Messaging Setup:**  
  SMTP configuration or API keys for alerting tools (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty) as needed.

- **Permissions:**  
  Sudo or root privileges for executing network service restarts and modifying network configurations.

---

## 4. Network Monitoring Setup

### 4.1. Tools and Technologies

- **Python Scripts:**  
  Custom scripts to perform periodic ping tests, measure latency, packet loss, and trigger alerts.
- **Logging:**  
  A centralized log file to record network metrics and incident events.
- **Systemd:**  
  Manage the Python monitoring script as a service for continuous operation.

### 4.2. Configuration File

**Path:** `/etc/network_monitor/config.json`

Example configuration:
```json
{
    "monitor_interval": 10,
    "targets": [
        {"host": "8.8.8.8", "name": "Google DNS"},
        {"host": "1.1.1.1", "name": "Cloudflare DNS"}
    ],
    "thresholds": {
        "latency_ms": 100,
        "packet_loss_percent": 5
    },
    "alert": {
        "email": "admin@example.com",
        "smtp_server": "smtp.example.com",
        "smtp_port": 587,
        "smtp_user": "alert@example.com",
        "smtp_password": "password"
    },
    "logging": {
        "log_file": "/etc/network_monitor/network_monitor.log",
        "log_level": "INFO"
    }
}
```

### 4.3. Python Monitoring Script

**Path:** `/etc/network_monitor/network_monitor.py`

Below is a sample script that monitors network metrics and triggers an incident response:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os
import time
import json
import logging
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from ping3 import ping

# ---------------------------
# Load Configuration
# ---------------------------
CONFIG_FILE = "/etc/network_monitor/config.json"

def load_config(config_path):
    if not os.path.exists(config_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Configuration file {config_path} not found.")
    with open(config_path, 'r') as f:
        return json.load(f)

config = load_config(CONFIG_FILE)
MONITOR_INTERVAL = config.get("monitor_interval", 10)
TARGETS = config.get("targets", [])
THRESHOLDS = config.get("thresholds", {})
ALERT_CONFIG = config.get("alert", {})
LOGGING_CONFIG = config.get("logging", {})

# ---------------------------
# Setup Logging
# ---------------------------
LOG_FILE = LOGGING_CONFIG.get("log_file", "/etc/network_monitor/network_monitor.log")
LOG_LEVEL = LOGGING_CONFIG.get("log_level", "INFO").upper()

logging.basicConfig(
    filename=LOG_FILE,
    level=getattr(logging, LOG_LEVEL, logging.INFO),
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)

# ---------------------------
# Helper Functions
# ---------------------------
def send_alert(subject, message):
    msg = MIMEText(message)
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    msg['From'] = ALERT_CONFIG.get("smtp_user")
    msg['To'] = ALERT_CONFIG.get("email")

    try:
        server = smtplib.SMTP(ALERT_CONFIG.get("smtp_server"), ALERT_CONFIG.get("smtp_port"))
        server.starttls()
        server.login(ALERT_CONFIG.get("smtp_user"), ALERT_CONFIG.get("smtp_password"))
        server.sendmail(msg['From'], [msg['To']], msg.as_string())
        server.quit()
        logging.info("Alert sent successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Failed to send alert: {e}")

def check_target(target):
    host = target.get("host")
    name = target.get("name", host)
    latency = ping(host, unit="ms")
    if latency is None:
        message = f"No response from {name} ({host})."
        logging.error(message)
        send_alert(f"Network Alert: {name} Down", message)
    else:
        logging.info(f"{name} ({host}) latency: {latency:.2f} ms")
        if latency > THRESHOLDS.get("latency_ms", 100):
            message = f"High latency detected for {name} ({host}): {latency:.2f} ms."
            logging.warning(message)
            send_alert(f"Network Alert: High Latency on {name}", message)

# ---------------------------
# Main Monitoring Loop
# ---------------------------
def main():
    logging.info("Starting Network Monitoring Script.")
    while True:
        for target in TARGETS:
            check_target(target)
        time.sleep(MONITOR_INTERVAL)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Notes:**

- The script uses **ping3** to measure latency and detect packet loss (using a lack of response as a failure condition).
- Alerts are sent via email when the latency exceeds a defined threshold or when a target does not respond.
- Logging records all events, making it easier to audit incidents.

### 4.4. Systemd Service Setup

**Path:** `/etc/systemd/system/network_monitor.service`

Create a systemd service file to run the monitoring script as a daemon:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Network Monitoring Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /etc/network_monitor/network_monitor.py
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=30
User=root
Environment=PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Setup Steps:**

1. Create the service file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/network_monitor.service
   ```
2. Paste the above content and save.
3. Reload systemd and enable the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable network_monitor.service
   ```
4. Start the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start network_monitor.service
   ```
5. Verify the service status:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status network_monitor.service
   ```

## 5. Incident Response Plan

### 5.1. Detection and Alerting

- **Automated Detection:**  
  The monitoring script checks each target periodically. If latency exceeds the threshold or a host becomes unresponsive, it logs the event and sends an immediate email alert.
  
- **Alert Recipients:**  
  Alerts are sent to a designated email address (or via alternative channels such as SMS or messaging apps) to notify network administrators.

### 5.2. Automated Incident Response

- **Scripted Responses:**  
  In addition to sending alerts, automated scripts can be triggered to restart network interfaces or services. For example, a secondary script might attempt to restart the network manager if an outage is detected.

- **Failover Procedures:**  
  If a primary connection fails, the system may automatically switch to a backup network route. Detailed scripts and configurations should be provided for these actions.

### 5.3. Manual Escalation Procedures

- **Escalation Workflow:**  
  In cases where automated responses do not resolve the issue, the documentation should outline a manual escalation path, including:
  - Notifying higher-level network engineers.
  - Activating on-call procedures.
  - Documenting incident details in a ticketing system for post-incident analysis.

---

## 6. Testing and Validation

To ensure the monitoring and incident response system is effective:

- **Simulate Network Issues:**  
  Temporarily block network connectivity to a target and verify that the script logs the event and sends an alert.
- **Review Logs:**  
  Check the log file (`/etc/network_monitor/network_monitor.log`) for entries indicating successful detection and alerting.
- **Email Verification:**  
  Confirm that alert emails are received with the correct subject and message content.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

If issues occur, consider the following steps:

- **Service Status:**  
  Check the status of the systemd service:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status network_monitor.service
  ```
- **Log Analysis:**  
  Review the log file for error messages:
  ```bash
  sudo tail -f /etc/network_monitor/network_monitor.log
  ```
- **Configuration Verification:**  
  Ensure the configuration file `/etc/network_monitor/config.json` contains accurate and up-to-date values.
- **Email Setup:**  
  Test the SMTP settings manually using a tool like `telnet` to ensure connectivity to the mail server.

---

## 8. Best Practices and Recommendations

- **Regular Updates:**  
  Periodically update the monitoring script and configuration to reflect changes in network infrastructure.
- **Security:**  
  Secure configuration files and restrict access to the monitoring scripts to authorized personnel only.
- **Documentation:**  
  Maintain an incident log and review incidents periodically to refine thresholds and response procedures.
- **Backup Communication:**  
  Configure multiple alert channels to ensure that notifications are received even if one channel fails.

---

## 9. Conclusion

The **Network Monitoring and Incident Response** system provides an automated solution to detect, log, and respond to network performance issues in real time. By integrating continuous monitoring with proactive incident response procedures, this solution helps minimize downtime and ensures that network administrators are promptly informed of any issues requiring attention.
